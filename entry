The following is an outline of the derectory structure of an entry, and a documentation of the content
* "Entryname"/
** reference.cc
   C++ reference implementation. In general you will need to implement
   atleast one reference implementation, or a special judge. If a
   reference implementation is made for a certain language, then the
   runnigtime constraints can be given as a factor for that
   language. The reference implemenation is used to calculate the
   correct responses for the inputs.
** reference.py
   Python reference implemenation, see [[reference.cc]].
** reference.java
   Java reference implemenation, see [[reference.cc]].
** specialjudge.cc
   c++ judge implemenation. A special judge must read the output from
   a solver from stdin, the exit value of the judge indicates its
   judgment:
   - 0 indicates that the output is correct.
   - 1 indicates that the output was incorrect.
   - 2 indicates an presentation error.


** specialjudge.java
   Python judge implementation, see [[specialjudge.cc]]
** specialjudge.py
  Java judge implemenation, see [[specialjudge.cc]].
